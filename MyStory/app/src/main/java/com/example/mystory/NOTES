- JSON string sent to server is of the form of
    {
        "op": String
        "data": String / Integer / JSONObject
    }
    where "op" is the name of the desired operation, i.e., "upload", "get_quote", etc;
    "data" corresponds to a either a nested JSONObject or a String or an Integer:

        (for upload)
        "data": {
            "username": String
            "quote": String
            "image": String of encoded image
        }

        (for get quote)
        "data": String of encoded image

        (for delete)
        "data": Integer of story label in Database

        (for load history)
        "data": String of username





- JSON string received from server is expected to be in the form of
    {
        "status": boolean
        "data": JSONArray
    }
    where "status" = true means the operation succeeded;
    "data" is a nested JSONArray:

    (for upload)
    "data": null

    (for get quote)
    "data": {
        [
            {"quote": String of quote1},
            {"quote": String of quote2},
            {"quote": String of quote3}
        ]
    }

    (for delete)
    "data": null

    (for load history)
    "data": {
        [
            {"image": String of encoded image, "quote": String of quote},
            {...}
            {...}
            ...
        ]
    }
